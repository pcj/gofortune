### Submitting an Issue
Before you submit your issue search the archive, maybe your question was already answered.

If your issue appears to be a bug, and hasn't been reported, open a new issue. 

### Submitting a Pull Request

Before you submit your pull request consider the following guidelines:

* Search GitHub for an open or closed Pull Request
  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.
* Please sign our <a href="https://www.clahub.com/agreements/pcj/gofortune">Contributor License Agreement</a> before sending pull
  requests. Code cannot be accepted without this.
* Make your changes in a new git branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature master
    ```

* Create your patch, **including appropriate test cases**.
* Follow our [Coding Rules](#coding-rules).
* Run the full test suite and ensure that all tests pass.
* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message.
* Push your branch to GitHub:

In GitHub, send a pull request to `vromero/gofortune:master`.

If the PR gets too outdated it may be asked to rebase and force push to update the PR:

```shell
git rebase master -i
git push origin feature/my-new-feature -f
```

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

#### After your pull request is merged

After your pull request is merged, you can safely delete your branch and pull the changes
from the main (upstream) repository:

* Delete the remote branch on GitHub either through the GitHub web UI or your local shell as follows:

    ```shell
    git push origin --delete feature/my-new-feature
    ```

* Check out the master branch:

    ```shell
    git checkout master -f
    ```

* Delete the local branch:

    ```shell
    git branch -D feature/my-new-feature
    ```

* Update your master with the latest upstream version:

    ```shell
    git pull --ff upstream master
    ```

## Coding Rules

To ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:

* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more tests.
* All public API methods **must be documented**.
* With the exceptions listed below, we follow the rules contained in
  [Google's Go Style Guide][https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments]:

## Signing the CLA

Please sign our Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before sending pull requests. For any code
